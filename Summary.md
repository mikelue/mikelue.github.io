## My speciality skills

* Have a view for design which concerns about _programming_, _testability_, _maintainability_, _security_, and _operability_.
* Know what kind of lacking knowledge will cause what kind of system problems.

## Make things right

As simple as I can, an application system composes following three important aspect of skills:

1. Knowing how to match your design with specifications, protocols, frameworks etc.(JSON Schema, HTTP, SpringFramework)
1. Knowing how to test your code.(From unit tests to maintainable integration tests)
1. Knowing how to use databases with best practices.(least indexes for acceptable performance. least cost for correct transaction)
